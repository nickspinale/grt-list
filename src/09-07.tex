\dfn{
    An Eulerian circuit is a closed walk that contains every edge exactly once.
    An Eulerian path is an open walk that contains every edge exactly once.
}

\thm{
    A graph contains an Eulerian circuit iff it is connected and all vertices have even degree.
}

\cor{
    A graph contains an Eulerian path iff it is connected and has exactly two vertices of odd degree.
}

\fact{
    If $G$ is a graph, then $\Sigma_{v \in V(G)} d(v)$ is even.
}

\prop{
    Every simple graph contains 2 vertices of even degree.
}

\dfn{
    A self-complimenting graph is isomorphic to its compliment.
}

\prop{
    The only two self-complimenting trees are the paths of length 2 and 4.
