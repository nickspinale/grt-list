\dfn{
    Two edges are independent if they are disjoint.
}
\dfn{
    A matching is a set of independent edges.
}
\dfn{
    If $G$ is a graph, then
    a matching containing every vertex in $G$ (i.e. a matching of size $\frac{|V(G)|}{2}$)
    is called a perfect matching.
}

\dfn{
    Assume $G$ is a graph.
    $G$ is called bipartite iff there exist disjoint sets $A$ and $B$ such that $A\cup B = V(G)$
    and $\forall e \in E(G) : e \not\subseteq A \wedge e \not\subseteq B$.
}

\thm{
    A graph is bipartite iff it does not contain an odd cycle.
}

\notation{
    Assume $G$ is a graph and $X \subseteq V(G)$.
    $N(X) = \{ v \in V(G) : \exists x \in X : xv \in E(G) \}$.
}

\thm[Hall]{
    Assume $G = \langle A,B,E \rangle$ is a bipartite graph.
    $G$ contains a matching covering $A$ iff $\forall X \subseteq A : |N(X)| \ge |X|$.
}

\cor[Frobeinus]{
    Assume $G = \langle A,B,E \rangle$ is a bipartite graph.
    $G$ contains a perfect matching iff $|A| = |B|$ and $\forall X \subseteq A : |N(X)| \ge |X|$.
