\dfn{
    A cycle that contains every vertex exactly once is called a Hamiltonian cycle.
}

\obs{
    If $G$ contains a Hamiltonian cycle, then:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $G$ is connected.
        \item $G$ has no vertices of degree 1.
        \item $G$ must remain connected after the removal of any edge.
        \item $G$ must remain connected after the removal of any vertex.
    \end{itemize}
}

\fact{
    If $G$ contains a Hamiltonian cycle, then after deleting any $k$ vertices,
    the resulting subgraph must have at most $k$ connected components.
}

\notation{
    $K_n$ denotes the complete graph on $n$ vertices.
    $C_n$ denotes the cycle on $n$ vertices.
}

\obs{
    Any complete graph contains a Hamiltonian cycle.
